# Personal Website About Early Modern European History
The site was created to practice my HTML/CSS/JavaScript skill. The contents on this website, such as paintings were collected from internet. I use the content recreationally to enchance my study in history. I hope my joined skill of history and programming can spark something special. Thank you for visiting.
